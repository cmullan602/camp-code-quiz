## Description

- I built this website application to test the users HTML, CSS and Javascript knowledge through a timed quiz and store high scores. 

- The website starts on the main index.html where the user is greeted with a message on the rules of the game. They have an option to start the game or view high scores. After clicking "start game" the user has 75 seconds to answer 5 questions. For every incorrect anwer the choice selected turns red letting the user know it was incorrect and 5 seconds is detracted from the timer. For every correct answer the choice selected turns green letting the user know it was correct and the user gains 100 points. At 15 secondds the timer will turn red letting the user know that time is running out. When time runs out or the user answers all 5 questions they are notified that the game is over and given thier score. They then have the option to submit their score. If it's amoung the top 5 scores in local storage they will see thier name on the leaderboard. The user is then given the option to play again if they would like. 

- The project contains an index.html file, a high-score.html file a style.css sheet and the html files are both linked to game.js and high-score.js respectively. 

- I really struggled through this assignment and it took me several hours of searching to find answers to do what I was looking to do. The javascript for the quiz was the biggest hurddle for me. Ultimately with the help of some instructor led demos and a youtube video posted by Brian Design I was able to accomplish what I was looking for and I'm proud of my work.
